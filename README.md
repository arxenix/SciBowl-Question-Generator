# SciBowl-Question-Generator
Test yourself with random science bowl questions!

This project was built using the Cloud9 IDE and uses NodeJS to fetch questions from a large JSON file. The JSON file was created by using Apache's PDFBox library for Java to parse all the official public question sets at http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/high-school/high-school-regionals/hs-rules-forms-resources/sample-science-bowl-questions
